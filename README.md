The Data Validation Engine (DVE) is a configuration-driven data validation library created and used by NHS England. It lets users define validation rules once and apply them across multiple dataset collections - supporting consistent, accurate data checks.

__The DVE offers__:

- SQL configuration-based validations
- Format normalization to Parquet for a unified data representation
- Data modelling and typecasting
- Business-rule validations executed on supported backends such as Spark and DuckDB, with the option to add custom backends
- Deriving new fields and entities
- Clear validation reporting, including summary insights and record-level error messages

As mentioned above, the DVE is "configuration driven" which means the majority of development for you as a user will be building a JSON document to describe how the data will be validated. The JSON document is known as a `dischema` (data ingest schema) file and example files can be accessed [here ↗️](https://github.com/NHSDigital/data-validation-engine/tree/main/tests/testdata). If you'd like to learn more about JSON document and how to build one from scratch, then please read the documentation [here ↗️](https://nhsdigital.github.io/data-validation-engine/).
